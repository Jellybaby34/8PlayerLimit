# 8 Player Duck Game
# Post bugs to the issue tracker. If I don't know about them I can't fix them

# Overview 
This is a mod for the game "Duck Game" which allows more than 4 players to join a single game. The end goal is that this mod will be able to be hosted on the workshop just like any other mod and allow large games.

# Installing
Because the source code uses 'Unsafe' code, Duck Game will not be able to simply compile the source at run time. You can either download the source and compile it yourself or simply download the compiled dll.

To install this mod you must download 8PlayerLimit.dll from this repository and put it in the following location:

C:\Users\<Your computers name>\Documents\DuckGame\Mods\8PlayerLimit

The file structure would then be as follows:

C:\Users\<Your computers name>\Documents\DuckGame\Mods\8PlayerLimit\8PlayerLimit.dll

Once it is there it will act like any other mod and you will be able to help test it.
